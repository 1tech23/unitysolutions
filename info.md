Hello and welcome to OneTech!
Any random numbers for the commit identifier are the commit number. It also means that the commit(s) was/were made from a remote device.

# Version infromation

Considering the fact that the URL for this website has been changed from oneenterprisestech.github.io to 1tech23.github.io, we have decided that it would probably be best to revamp the entire website in order to make it more professional and look more modern, with more of an interactive design and some hidden "easter eggs," if you will. Don't try to search for them, these "easter eggs" will be hard to find and, chances are, you will find them on accident at some point.
See https://1tech23.github.io/html/changelog.html or just the file changelog.html for more information tegarding changes and updates for the assets of this resource.

# Migration

We currently do not have any implemented migrations and, at least in the foreseeable future, have no intentions of doing any sort of migrations because of high prices and a perpetual lack of "giving two shits" about anything regarding migration and bettering this domain, seeing how it already meets the needs of the resources contained within this website. Yes, we have no more fucks to give. See this YouTube link to see how we feel: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dTF2thSafx8

# About

The website and it's assets have been in production since February 18, 2021. We are ravmping it and have deleted the old one and renamed the new one, and will be restarting our changelog. But the date that development began still stands because this website is still officially based on that first version with some major tweaks. Created by Logan Alldredge.  
The purpose of this website is, essentially, nonexistent. At least for the time being. It may just be an exceptionally fancy landing page from now on, with hidden access to secret features.

# SEO search

This website is available on Google and Bing. It can be found, and traffic is, hopefully, drawn to it. Property will (at some point) be drawn to a personal domain once we have enough money to pay for it. Unfortunately, as little to no traffic is seen, it may be quite some time before anyone even cares enough to purchase a domain.

Actually, it turns out that I will have to manually create a new SEO thing. Oh, well. It's fine, and I have no fucks left to give.

# Donations

All monetary donations are accepted. If you are interested in donating cash/check to Logan Alldredge, fill out this form on https://forms.gle/N5F5fpbbZPk6Z4YX6
You can click the button on the home page (https://1tech23.github.io) or the "donate" button on this repository. Or. you can just ignore this because we have accepted the fact that this useless website is, well, useless. And I don't think that donations are accepted anymore, so screw that.

# Final Remarks

I hope you find this useless website to be useful. Feel free to leave a comment, so much good that that will do.

# Domain

We previously had an active domain, but it was too much of a hassle, so we gave up on it for the time being.

You can still access this website on
