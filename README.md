# 1tech23.github.io

This website has many features, and so does this repository itself. 
Yes, I am calling it a repository because not only will it host my website (which is based on the previous website in the repo 1tech23.old) it will also host Linux software to be accessed, as well as my own custom Linux distribution OneOS.

OneOS is still in the development phase, and I aim to finish it eventually. The aim is to to make it integrate all three of the major kernels (Linux, Mac [Darwin], and Windows [NT], primarily Linux) as a subsystem.
This will prove to be incredibly difficult, especially getting permission from Microsoft and Apple. There is no projected timeframe for this, since this is a one-man company and definitely not represented by anyone other than myself.

All software and OS images will be able to be accessed on this website, and it will be structured like any Linux software repository, where the user can manually download all of the packages (like the Arch repos or the Debian repos), which means a lot of HTML.


Note that I am a busy man, I have a job, and a life to live, and this is just a side project. This will take some time and may not be done for a very long time. 
I have made many versions of OneOS (about five Debian-based versions and three Arch versions, working on an OpenSUSE version), but I lost it all due to carelessness and a very unfortunate loss of the backup drive.
